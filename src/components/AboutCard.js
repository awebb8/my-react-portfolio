                                I'm Alix Webb, and I'm currently a Web Developer in-training.  I was raised in many places throughout the Eastern U.S., but I currently live in Greenville, SC.  In 2014, I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering.  Post-graduation, I used my engineering skills to work for an automotive supplier for six years.  Because I wasn't feeling fulfilled, I sought out a new career direction in hopes of finding my dream job.  I hope to become a Full Stack Web Developer, but more than that, I hope to work for a company that has a great purpose.  My dream company does something for the greater good.  It is a company that is full of people who work hard but also know how to have fun.  It is a company that deeply cares for the well-being of its associates and pushes them to continuously learn and grow.
